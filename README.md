## Hello, welcome to Ken's github.
I am currently a sophomore Computer Engineering student at Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City, motivated with a passion to explore and try new things in the field of technology to be able to utilize them in making the world a better place for everyone. I am pretty much flexible with what I can do so that I can easily fit in with any role when it comes to collaborating with others.</br> 
<br>
I've been interested in Data Science lately since I believe that providing the right information and insights based on data is crucial in how society runs. I am also quite interested with statistics since high school, so I think that played a part too.
<br>

## Other things about me:
- Quite experienced in using Microsoft Excel (still can't understand VLOOKUP tho)
- Mediocre at multiplayer games
- Likes to mess around with virtual synthesizers via FL Studio and similar DAWs
- Currently learning to make pixel art
